# The Oro Platform - Business Application Platform (BAP)

The Oro Platform offers developers the exact business application platform theyâ€™ve been looking for,
by combining the tools they need. Built in PHP5 and the Symfony2 framework, it seamlessly integrates
into [OroCRM](http://www.orocrm.com/) or works entirely standalone.
Developing custom business applications has never been so easy.

## Installation

Platform is a package that requires an application to run it.
A [platform-application](https://github.com/orocrm/platform-application) is an example of such application which
simplifies initial project setup and configuration.

## Use as dependency in composer

In order to define dependency on platform in your project just add this to composer.json file:

```yaml
    "require": {
        "oro/platform": "1.0.*"
    }
```
